    "We will conduct a variable selection procedure with normal AR packages and an unweighted loss function. Then, this model will be recreated with `sklearn.Linear_Regression` in order to weight it. The variable selection procedure will compare the out-of-sample RMSE for several different time lags  and a standard set of FMDA covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many models include a time trend, or adding a term $\\beta t$, which would model a constant upward or downward trend. Moving average components are often used in time series modeling, extending the AR concept to ARIMA. For theoretical reasons, we are only considering autoregressive terms and not moving averages. We are using several other covariates, and the variable selection procedure could get cumbersome and lead to overfitting. Additionally, autoregressive covariate terms theoretically resemble finite-difference methods for differential equations, which are traditionally used in the Earth sciences. We don't see a corresponding scientific justification for moving average terms. For FMDA data, we will choose not to consider such time trend terms, as this is likely to chase noice in the training set. Additionally, we will include the hour of the day (1-24) to account for the daily cyclical patterns in fuel moisture. In the AR literature, this would be a \"seasonal\" affect, and would correspond to SARIMA modeling.\n",
